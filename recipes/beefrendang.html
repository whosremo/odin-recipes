    <h2>Beef Rendang Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        Rendang is an Indonesian dish that is also a staple throughout Singapore and Malaysia. This is a special dish that is a must-have during Indonesian festivities such as Hari Raya Eid and weddings. This is best served with rice, or with some lontong and ketupat, or steamed compressed rice cakes.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600g - 1kg Beef</li>
        <li>2 Lemongrass (Bruised)</li>
        <li>1 Chinnamon</li>
        <li>3 Star Anise</li>
        <li>5 Cloves</li>
        <li>5 Cardamom</li>
        <li>5 - 6 Makrut Lime Leaves</li>
        <li>500ml Santan or Coconut Cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp CoconutPalm Sugar</li>
        <li>120g Toasted Coconut Butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 Cup Water</li>
        <li>1/4 Cooking Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend together the spice base paste in a blender or food processor. Add water or oil for easier blending; you may not need to add if you have a good blender.</li>
        <li>To a pot, add oil. Once hot, add cinnamon, star anise, cloves and cardamom. Saute over low to medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the blended paste, and saute for about 5 minutes until fragrant, or when the paste has dried slightly and deepened in colour.</li>
        <li>Add in bruised lemongrass and the beef. Stir through, and let the meat draw out liquid. Continue to stir until the liquid has evaporated. The meat would also have shrunk slightly. This is will take about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk, salt, palm sugar, makrut lime leaves (tear or bruise first to release flavours), tamarind paste and kerisik. Stir to combine and turn the heat up to let it come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture boils, set the heat to the bare minimum. Put a lid on and let this stew for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Every 20 to 30 minutes, return to the pot, and give a stir to evenly distribute the caramelised coconut milk. With a spatula, scrape any bits sticking to the bottom of the pot, to prevent any burning. If you find your rendang drying out too soon, or before your beef is fully tender, feel free to add water halfway through.</li>
        <li>At the final half hour, keep a closer watch on the rendang and stir more often. A lot of the liquid would have been cooked off, so the spices are more prone to burning. Rendang is done once the beef is soft and tender to your liking!</li>
